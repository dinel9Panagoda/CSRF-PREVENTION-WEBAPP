# CSRF-PREVENTION-WEBAPP(SYNCHRONIZATION-TOKEN-PATTERN)

First and foremost you have to visit the Apache Friends website https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html to download XAMPP. In that website you can download the XAMPP server based on your Operating System. You can simply download the latest version. It might take some time to finish the downlading process. Once it is downloaded, you have to just open the executable file by double clicking to begin the installation process. If you have a password to your PC, then it will request for the password to proceed with the rest of the steps. Sometimes you might get warnings,  but you can simply click OK. Now you must have reached to the SETUP pop prompt, click NEXT for everything to install with default settings. Now you can see that the installation is being done. Finally, click FINISH to complete.

Now,it automatically open the CONTROL PPANEL. If it doesn't you can see it in the icon bar, or simply search for it and open. Now you can START the ApacheWebServer and MySQL Database by clicking START BUTTON under the Actions. First it will turn YELLOW and then will be changed to GREEN. You will see all the operations in the below screen.

At last you have to take all your PHP files to the HTDOCS folder located inside the C:Drive's XAMPP folder where the file path is C:\xampp\htdocs. All the implemented web app pages should be with ".php" extension. Now open up the WEB BROWSER and type localhost:portnumber. (You can write any port number recorded in the PID in the control panel next to the GREEN apache tag. Now you will be able to see a list of folders and files stored inside HTDOCS folder. Now click the php file and run.

NOTE: You can find the loginHome.php as the index or the home page to start with. :)
Since it makes easier for you'll to view all the files in the index, I have named it as loginHome.php. If not you can replace everything mentioned as loginHome.php to index.php. Then it will automatically open the web application without seeing the index files.

Thats it! ENJOY!!!
